# lempsugram

Instagram for Lemps. Finally!

## Brief

The idea is to mock a simplified instagram account and add content about Lemps.

Follow this design:

## Acceptance criteria

- Work on this project in pairs
- Use git for version control
- The picture info should be kept in an array, do not insert pictures directly to index.html
- When clicking on the picture, the title should appear, when clicking again, the title should disappear

### Bonus

- responsive design just like in instagram

## Tips
- Planning the workflow: decide on the tasks and share the responsibilites before you start coding
- Watch out for merge conflicts - try to work on separate components at all times
- Commit early and often
- Have explanatory commit messages
